## Objective
Our aim is to compare two models of Machine learning based on their performance on a Kaggle project. The project in question is the [Spooky Author Identification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification). 


## Data Format
The training and test datasets are in the form of sentences. The training set is 19580 sentences long. Each object in the training set consists of three parts:
- A sentence ID
- The sentence
- The class to which the sentence belongs to

### The three classes
1. Edgar Allan Poe abbreviated as **EAP**
2. Mary Shelley abbreviated as **MWS**
3. HP Lovecraft abbreviated as **HPL**

## The procedure that we will be following
We are using R programming to clean the data.
